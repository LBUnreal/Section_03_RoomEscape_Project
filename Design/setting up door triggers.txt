Attach new c++ component to door



include what you use (in OpenDoor.h)
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "Engine/TriggerVolume.h"

Set up door rotation in BeginPlay (in OpenDoor.cpp)

	// Get the owning Actor
	AActor* Owner = GetOwner();

	//Create a rotator
	FRotator NewRotation = FRotator(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

	//Set the door rotation
	Owner->SetActorRotation(NewRotation);

use UPROPERTY to expose a rotation angle (in OpenDoor.h)
	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)
		float OpenAngle = 90.0f; 

use UPROPERTY to expose a TriggerVolume variable to attach to door (in OpenDoor.h)
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
		ATriggerVolume* PressurePlate;

use UPROPERTY to add an Actor that will be used to trigger the door (in OpenDoor.h)
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
	AActor* ActorThatOpens

Note: for now, we are using polling
	if (PressurePlate && PressurePlate->IsOverlappingActor(ActorThatOpens))
	{
		//If the actor that opens is in the volume
		OpenDoor();
	}

Code gets moved to tick component in its own function:
void UOpenDoor::OpenDoor()
{
	// Get the owning Actor
	AActor* Owner = GetOwner();

	//Create a rotator
	FRotator NewRotation = FRotator(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

	//Set the door rotation
	Owner->SetActorRotation(NewRotation);
}

Now need to hook up the trigger volume and the actor to the open door component

The actor that opens can be found by using a top down approach in beginPlay (OpenDoor.h)
	ActorThatOpens = GetWorld()->GetFirstPlayerController()->GetPawn();
